## Basic Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game but you play it using `real life board`.

## How this works

[explain and add pictures]

## What are some improvements
 - Finding automatically on which port Arduino is;
 - Adding more components like buzzers so it has sound effects;
 - Adding a bluetooth module so it doesn't need to be connect via use cable;
 - Improving the looks using magnets (this was the first idea actually but I didn't have enought material);
 - Adding led diods to indicate players turn;
 - Change the look of the pygame;
 - ...and anything that your mind come up with;

## Just to be clear
  This is a side project and it was very fun building it, I always wanted to build something like this, but I will not work
  on this project again. I may build the better version of this like `Ultimate TicTacToe`.


## Libraries used
- `serial`  - `pygame`  - `time`
